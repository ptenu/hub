                Your single use password will be sent to the email you logged in with. It can take a minute or two
                for this email to arrive, so please wait. If it hasn't come after 4 or 5 minutes, try logging in again
                and you'll be sent a new password.
            </p>
            <p>
                For security reasons, we won't tell you if your email is incorrect, but we don't
                send passwords to emails unless they're registered to you on our system - therefore you should also check that
                the email you've entered is correct and is the same one you have registered with us.
